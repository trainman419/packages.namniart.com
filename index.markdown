# ROS Builds for ARM

Welcome to the homepage of the ROS packages for ARM. These builds should allow ROS users to install ROS on most of the available ARM platforms that can run Ubuntu or binary-compatible Ubuntu variants. I've found that they work well with both the stock Ubuntu builds and with the Linaro builds for various platforms.

Detailed installation instructions can be found on the ROS wiki:
